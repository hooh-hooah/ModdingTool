# Introducing hooh Modding Tools

## What is this?

This modding tool project is the collection of essential codes and resources to mod ILLUSION's AI/HS2.

This modding tool's base has been created by roy12, and I added some nice, easy-to-use modding tools to make everyone's life easier. 

## Complete Documentation / Modding Tutorials

Visit **http://hooh-hooah.github.io/** to check out what's the deal with this tool.

## How to use it?

1. Clone Repository
2. You can clone this project by clicking download as a zip or using git command git clone either way, and you can see whole commands in the top-right green button.
3. Open Editor
4. You need to open this project with Unity Editor to make your mods. If you don't have Unity Editor yet, I suggest you download **the Specific Version of Unity Editor** to use.
5. AI-Shoujo is currently using *the 2018.4.11f1* Version of Unity Engine. 
6. Try Examples
7. There is plenty of examples to try. If you have some time and see how it's working, I suggest you play with hooh's Modding Tools.

## Things to know

- You can edit most of my shaders with Amplify Shader Editor, a paid tool made by Amplify Studio. You can get this tool from the Unity Asset Store. If you want to make nice good shaders, I suggest you purchase it.
- Dynamic Bone is a paid component. **Do NOT use this component to make your game/profit out of these files** unless you have a legit copy from Unity Asset Store.
- In-Game components are for resolving the dependency between game and editor tools. I will not take any responsibility for using this code without getting a legit copy.
