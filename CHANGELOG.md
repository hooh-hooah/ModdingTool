#### :warning: ​**BREAKING CHANGES** :warning:

* ***Overall structure of the Modding Tool has changed!***
  
  * How to migrate?
  
    **You can't. Please download new version as new project.**
  
  * Why?
  
    To prevent things like this happen again, I've separated most of the editor codes into multiple Unity Packages. So we can update the codes separately later without screwing up everything agian.
  
* ***Modding Tool .xml file's Extension has changed!***
  ![](https://github.com/IL-Modding-Tool/Public-Resources/blob/master/xml-to-sxml.png?raw=true)
  
  * Why?
  
    **Because Unity won't let me to add Scripted Importer for .xml files:** so I had no choice.
  
  * How to migrate?
  
    Fortunately, the process is easy.
    **Just change *.xml files to *.sxml file.**

#### General Changes

* Improved mod validation
  * **Now mod validation check is automated.** Which means you don't have to constantly press check to see if the mod will be compile or not. Neat, Isn't it?
* Changed `SideloaderMod` class as `SerializedObject`. This object will be automatically imported if the mod.xml file is marked as sxml. (Related with the breaking changes.)
* Fixed most of the Package Issues by fixing everything as separate fork. Since the engine version is "Fixed", We really don't have to worry about the future supports. (Actually, I will take care of it mostly.)
* Fixed some Issues related with List Generation
  * Fixed that few male clothing list generation not working correctly.
  * Fixed that few female clothing list generation not working correctly. 
* Removed various unused code.
* Now you can build the mod with the sxml files.
* Countless of bug fixes.
